              The most ambitious undertaking of the institute in the past year was its decision to co-host the Inter IIT Sports Meet, with IIT Kharagpur. This decision led to a boom in the sports facilities that have been available to the students. The Students Activity Centre, or the SAC, has also been constructed, complete with indoor badminton and squash courts and 6 basketball and volleyball courts. The institute has also taken huge strides towards completing the other sports fields, such as the hockey field, the athletics track, the football field and the cricket ground. These amenities are still under construction and are expected to be completely ready by the end of the next academic year. These facilities will provide increasing opportunity to all the students and will further develop the institutes sports standards.

            <h3>Green Field Campus</h3>
          </header>
            <p class="p" align="justify">The horticulture activity started in the year 2015 as a first step towards ensuring a more vibrant and spirited environment filled with frondescence. The flora includes a variety of exotic and indigenous species (both deciduous and coniferous) like palm, pine, long-life tall trees and some medicinal plants.
The board members inaugurated the first phase of the Plantation Project by planting the saplings of Gulmohar and Mahogany around the Sports Ground on 10th July 2015. The main focus of the Horticulture Department, at least for the next five years lies in creating a natural landscape in newly constructed areas. Lush green gardens adorned with ornamental and medicinal plants help maintain a clean and healthy environment for the students and residents of the campus. 
Nurturing nature is not just a duty but it's a responsibility and IIT Bhubaneswar believes that this is the best way to promote creativity amongst students and the verdure also creates a positive effect on mental and physical well-being. The plants and tress shall be chosen in such a way that it creates a habitat for local birds, bees and butterflies. 
To achieve sustainability, the horticulture center focuses on building rooftop rainwater harvesting, surface rainwater harvesting infrastructure and setting up a waste management system and wastewater recycling plant. Also part of the 2015-2020 plan, an autonomous water irrigation system shall be set up to save expenditure.
